Now you've got a tricky bug, when you later use the index to retrieve from the container and get the last item. The behaviour of index is better; you can check for error (by using an exception handler), or if you can't handle it it propagates outward; all the code after the index can assume that the index is valid, because it won't be executed unless it was (or an exception handler has fixed the problem). Returning -1 to indicate error forces you to handle the error, and if you forget to you get silent data corruption
